Revesit the wise/impactful lines you read from a book

Ever happend that you read a wonderful book sometime ago, that book had a great positive impact on you but, with time you forgot it's teachings you wish you could have rememembered for ever. If yes, you're not alone. All of us go through similar situations more often than we think. 

Try to remember your favourite book. Now list down the 10 things which you appreciated the most in that book. Now repeat the activity for top 10 of your favorite books. Exhausting right?

Personal use was the starting motivation for this project. Upon sureveying random people, we came to realize that this problem is far more frequent that we ever expected. 

We created a small service, developed by novice programmers, which takes your kindle highlights and stores them in a database. Based on your selected frequency, we send you emails with your highlights with contextual information. 

We are currently in the phase of brainstorming and implementing ideas. Your suggestions and reviews will be highly appreaciated.  



## How to use

1. Go to your book on your Amazon kindle device.
2. Click on options, select notes option, click on export notes.
3. You will receive an email from amazon containing 2 attachments. Forward that email to "kinghuskier@gmail.com".
4. You're all set.
5. For any customizations requirements, please send an email to "kinghuskier@gmail.com" with "kindleplusplus" in the subject.
